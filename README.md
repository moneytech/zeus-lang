# Zeus Language
An embeddable or stand-alone general purpose scripting language designed for writing better build scripts and more robust and maintainable build scripts and system utilities.
## Goals
 - Simple, readable syntax provided by powerful object override semantics and the flexibility afforded by pattern matching
 - Multi-paradigm development provided by the low level functional style and higher level object oriented style which it permits
 - It should be painless to write readable and maintainable system utilities, Zeus will be an alternative to other system scripting languages like Makefiles and BASH scripts
